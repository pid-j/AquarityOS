# AquarityOS

An OS written in Python.

## What is AquarityOS?

AquarityOS is a text-based "operating system" which is made entirely from Python.

## Is it an operating system?

While it has the same behavior as Linux, for example, it is not an operating system.
Real operating systems are packed in an .iso file and allow you to flash it to a source of media.

## What exists in AquarityOS?

Not much for now, just some simple commands, such as:

- **echo** - Prints something to the standard output.
- **fetchdist** - A basic ripoff of neofetch with less features.
- **sudo** - Execute something with high-level privileges (currently unneccesary because package managers don't exist)

There is also no file system. While there is a variable in the main file that controls the current working directory shown
in the `user@pc folder$` command line interface, it does nothing. All it does is make it seem like a file system actually exists.

## When will I make an update?

Depends on how tired or lazy I feel.
